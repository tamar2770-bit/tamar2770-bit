Hey there 👋

I’m Amar Tamang, based in Australia 🇦🇺 and currently studying a Master’s in Information and Communications Technology. I’m working towards becoming a Data Analyst, learning tools like Excel, SQL, and Tableau, and building projects as I go. I’m someone who will always find an answer to a question, even if I don’t know it at first.

Alongside studying, I work part-time as a Graphic Designer, designing and printing traffic and commercial signs. I’m open to collaboration and always happy to learn from others.

Fun facts: I like to sing, Naruto is my favourite anime, and I’m into combat sports.
